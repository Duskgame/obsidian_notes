A native app is an application built specifically for a particular operating system or device, such as Android or iOS. Native apps use programming languages and tools designed for that platform (Java or [[Kotlin]] for [[Android]]; [[Swift]] or Objective-C for iOS). Because they are made for one system, native apps can fully access and utilize device features like the camera, GPS, microphone, and sensors, often offering better performance and a smoother user experience compared to web or hybrid apps.[](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/native-application-native-app)


Native apps are downloaded from app stores, installed directly onto devices, and can work offline if designed to do so. Examples include Google Maps, WhatsApp, Spotify, and Snapchat—all providing optimized functionality tailored to either Android or iOS.[](https://uxcam.com/glossary/native-app/)
