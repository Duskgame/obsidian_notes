An application programming interface (API) defines the rules that you must follow to communicate with other software systems. Developers expose or create APIs so that other applications can communicate with their applications programmatically.

An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response).

In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a [[Function]], an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and fulfill the request.

For example, the timesheet application exposes an API that asks for an employee's full name and a range of dates. When it receives this information, it internally processes the employee's timesheet and returns the number of hours worked in that date range.

For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the second being the low. 

You can think of a web API as a gateway between Clients and resources on the web.

You can think of an API as a mediator between the users or clients and the resources or web services they want to get.

Resources are the information that different applications provide to their clients. Resources can be images, videos, text, numbers, or any type of data. The machine that gives the resource to the client is also called the server. It’s also a way for an organization to share resources and information while maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to what.

 In addition, APIs help them to determine which clients get access to specific internal resources.

Another advantage of an API is that you don’t have to know the specifics of caching—how your resource is retrieved or where it comes from.
