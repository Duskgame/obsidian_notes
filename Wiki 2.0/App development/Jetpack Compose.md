Jetpack Compose is a modern, open-source UI toolkit developed by Google for building native [[Android]] user interfaces using the [[Kotlin]] programming language. Unlike the traditional Android approach that uses XML layout files, Compose enables developers to build UIs with a fully declarative style—describing what the UI should look like for a given state, and letting the framework handle rendering and updates as data changes.[](https://nordstone.co.uk/blog/jetpack-compose-transforming-ui-design-for-android-app-development-companies)


Compose uses composable functions—Kotlin functions annotated with `@Composable`—to define and manage UI components, making code more concise, readable, and maintainable. Its integration of powerful state management, Material Design components, and live previews streamlines app development and allows for fast iteration. Jetpack Compose is compatible with existing Android code, enabling gradual migration from traditional views, and supports modern features like theming, animations, and accessibility. This paradigm shift is transforming Android development by reducing boilerplate, minimizing bugs, and increasing overall development speed.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetpack_Compose)
