[Kotlin docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)

Kotlin is a modern, expressive programming language designed for flexibility, safety, and ease of use. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), is fully interoperable with Java, and is officially supported for [[Android]] development. Developers appreciate Kotlin for its concise syntax, null safety features, and strong support for both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.[](https://worldline.github.io/learning-kotlin/en/kotlin-features/)

## Key Features of Kotlin

- **Concise Syntax**: Kotlin reduces boilerplate by allowing features like data classes and top-level functions, making code shorter and easier to read compared to Java.[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin/introduction-to-kotlin/)
    
- **Null Safety**: Null handling is built into Kotlin’s type system, providing operators like `?` for safe access and `!!` for explicit assertions—features that help prevent common runtime errors (NullPointerExceptions) that often trouble Java developers.[](https://constructor.university/blog/kotlin-programming-language)
    
- **Interoperability**: Kotlin can seamlessly interact with Java code and libraries, making incremental adoption or migration simple for existing Java projects.[](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/[[[[Android]]]]-overview.html)
    
- **Functional Programming**: Kotlin includes lambda expressions, higher-order functions, and smart type inference for powerful and expressive coding, while Java’s functional features are less integrated and verbose.[](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/blog/kotlin-features/)
    
- **Top-Level Declarations**: Unlike Java, Kotlin allows functions and [[Variables]] to be declared outside of classes, simplifying code organization and usage.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_\(programming_language\))
    
- **Extension Functions**: Kotlin lets you add methods to existing classes without inheritance, keeping code cleaner and more modular—this isn’t possible in standard Java.[](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/blog/kotlin-features/)
    
- **Default [[Arguments]] & Named Parameters**: Kotlin functions can specify default values for parameters and allow callers to clarify [[Arguments]] by name, features that make [[Function]] calls more readable and less error-prone than Java.[](https://worldline.github.io/learning-kotlin/en/kotlin-features/)
    
- **Multiplatform Capability**: Kotlin supports code compilation to JavaScript and native binaries, enabling cross-platform development for mobile, web, and desktop, while Java is mainly confined to JVM platforms.[](https://developer.[[[[Android]]]].com/kotlin/overview)

[[A Programming Kotlin]]

Kotlin’s improvements over Java result in safer, cleaner code and faster development, especially for [[Android]] and multiplatform projects. Developers coming from Java find Kotlin easy to learn, thanks to its familiar syntax and the ability to gradually migrate existing codebases.[](https://constructor.university/blog/kotlin-programming-language)
