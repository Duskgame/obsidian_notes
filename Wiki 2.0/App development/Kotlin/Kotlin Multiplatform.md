[Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) is a cross-platform development technology from JetBrains that enables developers to share Kotlin code across various platforms, including [[Android]], [[iOS]], desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux), web, and server. Its main goal is to allow teams to reuse business logic and core functionality in a common [[Kotlin]] module while keeping user interfaces and platform-specific [[API]]s native to each platform, optimizing both development speed and native user experience.[](https://riseuplabs.com/kotlin-multiplatform-development-comprehensive-guide/)

## Key Concepts and Features

- **Shared Codebase**: Developers can write code once in [[Kotlin]] (for business logic, networking, data models, etc.) and deploy it on multiple platforms, reducing duplication and maintenance effort.[](https://www.holdapp.com/blog/what-is-kotlin-multiplatform)
    
- **Native UI**: UI components for each platform can still be written using native tools, ensuring optimal performance and platform fidelity. Recent advancements have introduced Compose Multiplatform, allowing shared UI code for [[Android]] and desktops, with growing support for other platforms.[](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-reasons-to-try.html)
    
- **Gradual Adoption**: Teams can choose what code to share and migrate incrementally—there’s no need to refactor existing projects all at once.[](https://www.netguru.com/blog/kotlin-multiplatform-introduction)
    
- **Native Performance**: [[Kotlin]] Multiplatform uses platform-specific APIs and compiles to native binaries, meaning apps can run efficiently and access all native features.[](https://www.netguru.com/blog/kotlin-multiplatform-pros-and-cons)
    
- **Interoperability**: The technology is designed to work smoothly with popular languages and frameworks, such as Java on the JVM and [[Swift]]/Objective-C on [[iOS]].[](https://riseuplabs.com/[[[[Kotlin]]]]-multiplatform-development-comprehensive-guide/)
